**Description:**  
Build a web app to track your daily tasks. You’ll use TypeScript to define types, interfaces, functions, classes, and generics.

- Mark tasks as completed
- Filter tasks (all, completed, pending)

**TypeScript Concepts Covered:**
- **Types:** Define types for task properties (title, completed, etc.)
- **Interfaces:** Create an interface for a Task object
- **Functions:** Write functions to add, update, and delete tasks
- **Classes:** Optionally, use a class to manage the task list
- **Generics:** Create a reusable function or class for filtering tasks
